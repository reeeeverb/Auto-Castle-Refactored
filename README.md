# Auto-Castle

## Chessboard TODO:
- Recreate to allow for programmatic adding of widgets(pieces)
- Implement pawn promotion
  - need a fancy lil mini gui
- Check, checkmate, etc
  - Checkmate still needed
    - legal moves array?
  - Check from other kings
- Stalemate
- Timers

## What We Learned from Previous Implementation
- seperate the GUI from the backend
  - no shit
- do a more fn approach rather than OO
- complete generailty of methods
- all operations should be preformed on arrays and then passed to GUI
