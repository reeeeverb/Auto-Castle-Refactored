# Auto-Castle

## Chessboard TODO:
- Stalemate
- Timers

## Engine notes:

#### Evaulation
- Evalutation has 2 main methods 
  - hand-crafted
  - neural networks
    - only one really in use these days
    - start with this one 

#### Hand Crafted Evalution 
- **Negamax** is minimax but each side is capable of being scored


## What We Learned from Previous Implementation
- seperate the GUI from the backend
  - no shit
- do a more fn approach rather than OO
- complete generailty of methods
- all operations should be preformed on arrays and then passed to GUI
